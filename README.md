## 1. Installing Required Libraries

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) 


WINDOWS : Press windows + R. Type in cmd and press enter
MAC OS  : Press command (âŒ˜) + Space Bar to open Spotlight search. Type in Terminal and press enter.

Use the next set of commands to install NumPy and Pillow using the following instructions
```
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install pillow
python -m pip install matplotlib
```


## 2. User Guide

To run just double click on the 'Launcher' file

Loading images : File -> Open, then select any JPG image OR (if applicable) File -> Recents 
Creating a blank image : File -> New

The menubar menus now become usable; check out the attached video for a demo !


NB: The following features are not featured in the video (available upon request): 
 
 - You can place a grid for precision drawing in the 'View' menu
 - You can get the image's color intensities by selecting Get Histogram in the Image Menu
 - You can deselect your drawing tool by double clicking the right mouse button


## 3. Known Issues

- When drawing with a small thicknes, moving your mouse too fast may cause the drawed line to appear inconsistent, this is caused by Tkinter's mainloop refresh rate
 - The image may rarely go out of bounds, if that happens, try the Zoom Auto command (Ctrl+A)
 - Support is limited for PNG and ICO files, use at your own risk ! (JPEG fully supported)

## 4. Future Additions
 - Full support for all image files
 - Rework of the editing tools to be fully independent from pillow's ImageEnhance and ImageFilter modules
 
## 5. Changelog
 - All menus are fully working
 - Code refactored to be more efficient and readable
 - Drawing tools implemented
